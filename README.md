# critical-action-recognition-and-anticipation
Surgical workflow analysis integrates perception, comprehension, and prediction of the surgical workflow, which helps real-time surgical support systems to provide proper guidance and assistance for surgeons. 
This paper promotes the idea of _**critical actions**_, which refer to the essential surgical actions that progress towards the fulfillment of the operation.
Fine-grained workflow analysis involves recognizing current critical actions and previewing the moving tendency of instruments in the early stage of critical actions. 
Aiming at this, we propose a framework that incorporates operational experience to improve the robustness and interpretability of action recognition in in-vivo situations. 
High-dimensional images are mapped into an experience-based explainable feature space with low-dimension to achieve critical action recognition through a hierarchical classification structure. 
To forecast the instrument's motion tendency, we model the motion primitives in the polar coordinate system (PCS) to represent patterns of complex trajectories. 
Given the laparoscopy variance, the **adaptive pattern recognition (APR)** method, which adapts to uncertain trajectories by modifying model parameters, is designed to improve prediction accuracy. 
The in-vivo dataset validations show that our framework fulfilled the surgical awareness tasks with exceptional accuracy and real-time performance.
